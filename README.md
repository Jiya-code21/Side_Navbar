~ Interactive Side Navbar 🚀

Why Build This? 🤔
>> Everyone loves clean and user-friendly interfaces! A compact and interactive sidebar helps to organize navigation better, making websites more intuitive for users.

What Did We Make?✨
1). A side navigation bar that expands smoothly on hover 🎯.
2). Integrated icons for features like "Add Task," "Search," etc. 🖼️.
3). The hidden text labels become visible only when the sidebar expands, saving space 💡.

How Does It Work? 🛠️
1️⃣ CSS Transition:Adds smooth hover effects when the sidebar is expanded.
2️⃣ Flexbox:Ensures the icons and text align properly in the sidebar.
3️⃣ Responsive Design:Sidebar adjusts beautifully on different screen sizes 📱💻.
4️⃣ Text and Icon Combination:Hidden text becomes visible on hover for better UX/UI.
